              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Do you offer package deals?</strong><br>
                Generally, no.  All of our items are priced individually.  This is because each event is unique and requires differnt items.  We do offer specials and discounts at times for certain items.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Are there minimum quantities that I need to rent?</strong><br>
                Rental items can be rented in any quantities; however, we do have delivery minimums during certain times of year.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Am I responsible for cleaning linens?</strong><br>
                No.  Please shake out all linens, place them in a bag, and leave them with other items.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>What should I do if I receive my order and items are missing or damaged?</strong><br>
                All rental items are expected at the item of delivery, but if an issue does arise, please call us immediately, so we can resolve the issue.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>How far in advance should I make a reservation?</strong><br>
                Reservations are subject to product availability.  Once you have selected a date, it is important to reserve items as soon as possible.  Large events and weddings, you should reserve at least 6 months out to guarantee the items you would like.  While we do try to accommodate last minute reservations, typically, inventory is limited during peak months. 
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>What is required to make a reservation?</strong><br>
                To make a reservation, we require a signed copy of your quote as well as a 50% non-refundable initial payment.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Can I make changes to my reservation?</strong><br>
                You can make additions at any time prior to delivery, but additions are subject to availability at the time.  We do allow for you to reduce counts of tables, chairs, and linens up to 2 weeks prior to your event, but no more than 10% of the original quantity.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Should I call Miss Utility if I am reserving a tent?</strong><br>
                We are required by law to call in a Miss Utility ticket any time we stake into the ground.  BK Rentals handles calling Miss Utility 7 days prior to your event.  Please remember that Miss Utility will only mark public utilities and does NOT mark private utilities or sprinklers.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>When is the final balance due?</strong><br>
                All final balances are due 2 weeks prior to the event date.  If additions are made within the 2 weeks, payment is due at the time of the change.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Do you deliver?</strong><br>
                Yes, but keep in mind that we do have delivery minimums during our peak times. 
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>What time will my delivery arrive?</strong><br>
                It will arrive before your event.  While we do try to deliver all tent rentals at least one day prior to the event, smaller rentals may be delivered the morning of an event.  The schedule is typically finalized the Monday prior to your event because weather is a major factor in determining our schedule.  Typically, once the day is scheduled, we will give you a time window and you will receive a call 30-60 minutes prior to arrival.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Can you deliver at a specific time?</strong><br>
                Yes, however, there are additional fees that will apply if we must deliver and/or pick up at a specific time.  Please let our office know when calling if you need specific times.  We will do our best to accommodate specific times, but there are factors that are out of our control and it can be impossible.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Do you set up the rental items?</strong><br>
                Delivery crews will set up all items which are rented with a tent.  If you only rent tables and chairs, our crew will leave them stacked in a designated place.  If you need tables and chairs set up, prior arrangements are required, and additional fees will apply.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>How can I pay for my rentals?</strong><br>
                We accept cash, check, and all major credit cards.  Credit card payments can be made using our payment portal on our website.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Can I get a refund on items that I do not use?</strong><br>
                No.  We do not refund unused items.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>What is your cancellation policy?</strong><br>
                If you cancel prior to 120 days before your event, initial payments will remain on file for 1 year to use on a future rental.  Within 120 days your initial payment is forfeited.  Cancel within 30 days and balance is due in full with no refunds or credit.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <strong>Do I need to be home when my rentals are delivered?</strong><br>
                It is recommended, but not necessary for you to be home when your order is delivered.  If you are not going to be home or are uncertain if someone will be there at the time of delivery, please make sure that the tent area is clearly marked and that our staff knows where you would like other rentals stored.
